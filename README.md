# Marine Biology Slots
Developed by TJ Roncal on April 28, 2023

## Description
This game was created with a simple intention.  I wanted to have a clean design and straightforward functionality, without all of the clutter that one might see on an actual slot machine.  With this in mind, I opted to have only 2 buttons: "Swim" to represent the spin-button and "Dive Deeper" for the reset-button.  An underwater theme was added to give the game some style and I used emojis of creatures from the deep to represent the different values that would appear on my payline slots. A message then appears under the header to indicate whether the player has won or lost.

## Next Steps
Some of the enchancements I would like to add to the game are as follows:
* Adding animated bubbles that would rise to the top of the webpage starting from the bottom
* Adding variables that would store the player's current balance, bet, and winnings, while indicating those values on the webpage
* Place the playline in a more traditional slot-machine format, showing the moving slots on top and below the playline
* Replacing the "Swim" spin-button with a slot lever that the player could click, with corresponding animation
* Generating more sound effects to indicate a win or a loss from the player
